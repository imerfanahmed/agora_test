### 5. `agora-community.spec.ts` - Original Combined File (14 tests)

## Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 90 (with original file) / 48 (without original file)
- **Passing**: 87 (97% pass rate)
- **Failing**: 3 (WebKit navigation timing issues)

## Benefits of Split Structure
1. **Focused Testing**: Each file tests a specific area of functionality
2. **Better Maintenance**: Easier to find and update specific tests
3. **Parallel Execution**: Tests can run more efficiently in parallel
4. **Clear Organization**: Logical separation by feature/component
5. **Easier Debugging**: Isolated test failures are easier to troubleshoot

## Recommendations
- Remove `agora-community.spec.ts` to eliminate test duplication
- Consider keeping `example.spec.ts` for reference or remove if not needed
- The current split provides good coverage and organization
